What is Kivi?
--------------
Kivi is a high performance in-memory key-value database written in the Zig programming language. Kivi is designed to be embeddable, concurrent, and fast.

Kivi is currently in development mode and not production ready. Here's a checklist about what things that are ready:
- [x] Getting ready our first version of the core
- [ ] Making a JS library for embedding and using the core that works in Node/Deno/Bun (95% done)
- [ ] Making server in order to provide access over the network
- [ ] Making a client that can access the database over the network
- [ ] Adding access-over-network support to the JS library
- [ ] Making a benchmark that compares performance difference between Kivi and its competitors
- [ ] Start porting to other languages: Rust, Python, etc...
